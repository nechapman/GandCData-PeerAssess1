Peer Assessment for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course


1. Get a copy of the R Script as part of this GitHub link.
2. Get a copy of the Source data Zip (the link is in the CodeBook.md and commented out in the Script) - the script requires the default directory, file and sub-folder/file names.
3. Unzip the Source data Zip into the default folder, from your R working directory.
4. Run the script with the command>    source("run_analysis.R")
The script has dependencies on the packages "stringr" and "reshape2". These are included in the script as require() commands.

The script will produce several variables (as working) towards the final objective the "tidy_set" variable, a 180x69 data frame.
